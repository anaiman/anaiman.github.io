<p>I'm going to answer some FAQs here, in no particular order:</p>
<h3>Where are you going?</h3>
<p>I'm going to Afghanistan, where I'll be working in a lab at <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/04kA">Kandahar Airfield</a>.  I'll probably be doing some traveling around the country, too, mostly by air.</p>
<h3>Wait, don't you have a PhD?  Why the heck are you going to Afghanistan?</h3>
<p>A very good question.  My company has a contract to support an Army unit that is tasked with providing solutions to problems that soldiers are having in the field.  To do this, we send highly qualified scientists and engineers into war zones to provide engineering and technology solutions with extremely fast design and production cycles.  Where the typical government procurement process might take <strong>years</strong> to go from need to solution to fielded product, we talk to soldiers about problems they're having, come up with solutions, and prototype products in <strong>days to weeks</strong>.  With that kind of turnaround, we can iterate on our designs based on feedback from soldiers and come up with solutions that make their jobs easier.</p>
<p>In some ways, this is a dream job for me - I'll be using my engineering knowledge to make these folks, who have one of the hardest and most dangerous jobs in the world, safer and happier.  It's hard to imagine having a more immediate impact on the world through engineering.  I'm pretty excited about getting to go do this.</p>
<h3>Hmm, ok then.  So when are you going?</h3>
<p>The current plan is for me to be in theater from June through November.  Sometimes plans change, but that's the current plan.</p>
<h3>Wow, that's like five months!  How does your wife feel about that?</h3>
<p>It's going to be a long time, that's for sure.  I will get a two week break in the middle, over which we'll be meeting up somewhere for a very nice and relaxing vacation.  Location is still TBD.  Overall, she's been really supportive of the whole idea, which is just one of those many reasons that I love her.  We'll be talking all the time, which will help a lot.</p>
<h3>Are you going to have a gun?</h3>
<p>No.  I am not a soldier and I have no business carrying a weapon.  I'm leaving that to the professionals around me.</p>
<h3>What's your address/phone number over there?</h3>
<p>If you'd like my mailing address or phone number, send me an email.  We have an APO address at the lab and as one of the largest bases in Afghanistan, mail actually gets here pretty quickly.  Likewise, we have a commercial landline phone in the lab with a Virginia area code, so calling CONUS is not a problem.  I'm also available some days early in the morning and late in the evening to talk or video chat on Skype, FaceTime, or Google+.  Isn't technology great?</p>
