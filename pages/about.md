I'm Alex - aerospace engineer, builder, coder, and occasional writer.  I originally began this site in 2012 to blog about my experiences doing prototype engineering in Afghanistan for the US Army.  I've recently revived it to showcase some of the other projects I've been working on more recently.

How about that site name?  Urban Dictionary defines FTW (it stands for For The Win, in case you were wondering) as "An enthusiastic emphasis to the end of a comment, message, or post.  Sometimes genuine, but often sarcastic."  My perspective is that engineering has the power to change the world for the better, and often does.  On the other hand, a lot of the time it seems like it was someone else's engineering that got things into a mess in the first place.  So when I'm able to use brains, some science or technology, and 5-minute epoxy to make things work, that's a genuine win.  The rest of the time, engineering . . . FTW.  But at the end of the day, things get better.  And that's why I like what I do.

I hope you'll enjoy reading - please get in touch using the <a href="/pages/contact/">Contact </a>page if you have questions.
