title: "Quick Update: I\u2019m back on KAF"

Lena and I had an awesome two week vacation in Iceland, but now I’m back at
KAF.  My trip back took from 7 AM Iceland time on Friday until 2:30 PM KAF
time on Saturday, and I didn’t have a chance to sleep during that time, so my
body clock is a bit messed up and I’m exhausted.  Hence, I’m going to bed
instead of writing a long post about my trip, but don’t worry, it’ll come this
week.  For now, here’s a preview:

Lots more photos and trip stories where that one came from.  You’ll hear from
me again soon.
