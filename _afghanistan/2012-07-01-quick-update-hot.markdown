New temperature record on the thermometer in the shade outside our lab today.
I think this is a legitimate 110 F.

Now, I know a lot of the U.S. is baking right now, so I may not be getting
much sympathy, but let me put it this way – in the month (four weeks tomorrow)
that I’ve been here, the high temperature has failed to break into triple
digits only once.

On a related note, Lena and I are going to Iceland for my R&R at the end of
July/beginning of August (average July high temperature: 60 F) .  It’s
actually kind of crazy how quickly that’s coming up.  It’s going to be tough
having the second “half” of my deployment being 50% longer than the first
part, but I think it’s worth it to spend our first anniversary together.
We’re definitely looking forward to it!

Here’s a new feature: my dumb move of the day (DMOTD, note: I hope that this
won’t become a regular feature).  Tonight, Skip and I headed out to the other
side of KAF for dinner and then showers.  Except that I forgot to grab the
room key, so I couldn’t get to where I leave my towel and soap.  So instead I
used the bathroom soap (luckily it’s in small, portable bottles) and dried off
with my clean shirt.  On the plus side, that shirt was nearly dry by the time
we got back to the lab since it’s so hot outside still.  Awesome.
