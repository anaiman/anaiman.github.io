title: Hot and Dusty

It’s pretty hot and dusty here.  That’s kind of an understatement.  It’s been
100 F or hotter here every day that I’ve been here – most days the high is in
the 104-106 range, and we had one 110 day.  On the plus side, you never need
an umbrella or rain jacket.

It was only 104 F in the shade at 1500 this afternoon.

It’s also quite dusty.  Again, understatement.  The ground outside is all dust
here.  There are some different varieties of dust, ranging from gravelly areas
that are slowly being turned into dust by the 10-20 ton trucks driving over
them to piles of very fine sand that we call “moondust” because you leave boot
prints in it like you’re an astronaut.

A dusty street on KAF.

The dust gets everywhere, and there’s not much you can do about it.  We do
have a specialized piece of equipment in the lab called a “DustHound” with
which we try to keep the floors clean (it’s a broom).  Today I tried using our
ShopVac to vacuum the bedroom and it helped a little bit, but the fact is that
everything is a little dusty here.  Just one of those things we learn to live
with, I guess.  On the plus side, all the dust in the air makes for very nice
sunsets.

The sun sets behind some rocky hills to the west of KAF.
