Evidently the REF is doing a little PR work, because this (and a longer linked
news story) showed up online over the weekend:

[Deploying MacGyver to Afghanistan](http://defensetech.org/2012/08/17
/deploying-macgyver-to-afghanistan/ "http://defensetech.org/2012/08/17
/deploying-macgyver-to-afghanistan/")

The animation is especially fun.  Currently the Expeditionary Lab – Mobile
(ELM, the official name for what we call the mobile lab) is not able to be
slung under a helicopter, although that was the original idea.  Double dose of
AOTD today because I’ve been neglecting it lately:

AOTD: HLZ – Helicopter Landing Zone.  I should have had this in my last post,
but the HLZ is the spot on most FOBs where helicopters land.  You can also
have HLZs pretty much anywhere, I guess – the main criteria are flat-ish
terrain and lack of tall objects.  The HLZ on Masum Ghar also doubles as a
sports field (more on this later).

REF – Rapid Equipping Force.  I don’t know how I haven’t covered this yet, but
the REF is the Army organization that I work for, as you may have gathered
from the article linked above.  They’re bigger than just the projects we do –
they do a bunch of work to take commercial, off-the-shelf technology, modify
it, and put it in the hands of soldiers in the field.  They differ from most
other Army (and government, for that matter) in that they say they’re going to
do things rapidly and are often successful at it.
