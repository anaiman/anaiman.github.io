Today was a momentous day here at KAF: for the first time in the nearly three
weeks I've been here, the thermometer outside our lab failed to reach triple
digits.  Yes, the high was 99, but it felt so much cooler.  Ok, not really,
but in the shade with the wind gusting to 20 or 30 miles per hour, you could
almost imagine that it felt cooler.

This photo isn't from today, nor is it relevant to the cold snap, but I
thought it was fairly awesome.

They really like to dress up their trucks here.  Although the mural on this
tanker is quite impressive, I have not yet seen a true “jingle truck” on KAF.
I suspect that’s because they’re not allowed on KAF.  True jingle trucks are
painted with crazy murals, like this one, plus they have chains hung all
around them like a fringe that makes an insane racket while driving (hence the
name).  If I see one, you’d better believe I’m stopping for a photo.
