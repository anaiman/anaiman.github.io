I have a whole bunch of stuff to post about, but all of the posts I want to
make involve photos that I have yet to take. Therefore, I don’t have anything
significant to report today.  Here’s the current scene outside the lab:

I don’t know if you can tell, but the air quality is pretty terrible right
now.  Apparently, they’re burning our trash tonight, and the wind happens to
be blowing from the burn site toward the airfield.  The wind patterns here at
KAF are kind of difficult – there seems to be a frequent 180 degree shift in
the prevailing direction.  That may explain why our waste treatment facility
is located upwind (most of the time) of the airfield.  You’ll probably hear
more about that later.

AOTD: NSTR – Nothing Significant To Report.  This one’s pretty self-
explanatory.
