title: Happy Birthday to Me
type: post

Birthdays away from home are never the most fun.  Birthdays in a war zone . .
. yeah, not the best.  On the plus side, this week I got a care package from
Lena, presents from my parents and Lena’s parents, and even a card from my
grandmother.  I also got poked fun at by the guy who has to go pick up the
mail from the post office.  A small price to pay, though.

Quite a pile of loot.  Highlights were two pounds of coffee from my parents
(we make our own around here since the DFAC coffee is very hit or miss), a
Lego set from Lena (yay, Legos!), and a Red Sox Mr. Potato Head (um, yeah,
also from Lena).  The giant black and yellow things with the bright yellow
frisbee are a game called KanJam (a hit with all the kids these days, if you
haven’t heard of it) that Lena’s parents got me.  I’m guessing it’s better if
you make it a drinking game, but since we only have “near beer” here, we’ll
have to make do.  It will be making an appearance at the 4th of July bbq
tomorrow.  Thanks everyone!

On the downside, we had another record high today (you’d think I’d learn to
stop posting these, but no).  That’s either 112 or 113 depending on how tall
you are.  Tomorrow is supposed to be more of the same.  Blech.
