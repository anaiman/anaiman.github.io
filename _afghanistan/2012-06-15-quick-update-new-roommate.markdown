title: 'Quick Update: New Roommate'
type: post
---

We’re having some turnover in personnel at the lab here in KAF this week.  My
coworker who had been working here with me, Jon, headed up to Bagram
yesterday, where he’ll be for the rest of his deployment.  My new roommate
arrived today – actually, he was on R&R and just returned, so I’m sort of the
new roommate.  So I’ll be working with Skip here in KAF for most of the rest
of my deployment.  Skip is also the senior guy here in KAF, since he’s a
manager at my company.  This is good for work – he’s been here for a while
already, plus he knows how to manage.  It’s a bit odd for living arrangements,
though, since he’s not my age like Jon was.  Also, I just met him for the
first time today.  Luckily, he seems like a nice guy.  Kind of reminds me of
freshman year of college, somehow . . .

AOTD: AMR – Air Movement Request.  If we want to fly somewhere in Afghanistan,
and we know about it far enough ahead of time (7-10 days), we can file an AMR
to get a semi-reserved seat on a flight.  Sometimes you get bumped if a
sufficiently high-ranking person needs to take your seat, but mostly this is
like booking a flight.  There are other ways of flying, which I’ll cover
later.
