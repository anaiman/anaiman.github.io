The Boardwalk is the epitome of all that is strange about this place where I’m
living and working.  It is best introduced with a picture:

This is the Boardwalk.  It’s a roughly square, covered wooden walkway.  The
outside is lined with shops, restaurants, and other things you’d never expect
to find on an ad hoc military base in the middle of a war zone.  There’s a TGI
Fridays, a KFC, two barber shops, jewelry stores, rug stores, electronics
stores, several decent coffee places, at least two good ice cream places, and
several really bad pizza places.

The inside of the square is full of sports arenas.  Around the edge is a
quarter-mile track (with painfully square corners).  There’s a field-turf
soccer field (also used for football and ultimate frisbee), volleyball courts,
and a basketball court with no nets.  The crowning glory is this one, built
and left by the Canadians:

Yep, that’s a hockey rink.  No, it doesn’t have ice, it’s for street hockey.
I haven’t seen it used for hockey, but it also seems to serve as a dance floor
on Friday nights.

Nights at the Boardwalk deserve further mention.  Several of the shop areas
have neon night lighting, lending the area a definite Vegas feel.  Despite the
rules of KAF (no alcohol and no fraternization), there are several nightspots
that can only be described, on weekend nights, as “hopping”.  Like I said, the
hockey rink seems to have a double use as a dance floor, usually for some sort
of line dancing or something.  There’s also a small stage area where
soldier/musicians sometimes perform.  And of course, there’s one of the pizza
restaurants, Mama Mia’s, where they clear all of the tables aside and have an
actual DJ playing club music.  Yep, the Boardwalk is definitely a KAF
original.

AOTD: FOB – Forward Operating Base.  A FOB is the largest size category of
bases in Afghanistan.  Kandahar and Bagram are usually referred to as “super-
FOBs”, since they are larger than the average FOB.  I haven’t seen many, but I
gather that the typical FOB is home to something like 500 to 2,000 soldiers.
KAF and Bagram have significantly more than that.
