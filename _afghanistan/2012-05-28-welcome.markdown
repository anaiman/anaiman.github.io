Welcome, new readers!

Since I just invited a whole bunch of you to read this blog (as you can see, I
started it a while back, but hadn't actually let anyone see it yet), I thought
I'd say hi.Â  I'm really super busy right now, so I probably won't respond to
too many emails, but take a look at the [About
](/pages/about/ "About")and [FAQ
](/pages/afghanistan-faqs/ "FAQs")pages and many of the
questions you have will be answered . . .

I hope you find this blog entertaining/informative or at least useful as a way
of knowing that I'm doing well overseas. Enjoy!
