summary: Rapid prototyping and engineering support for the US Army in Afghanistan.
---

While working at [Exponent](http://www.exponent.com), one of my largest
projects was to provide ongoing support to our US Army client, the [Rapid
Equipping Force](http://www.ref.army.mil/index.html).Â  In this role, I spent
six months in Afghanistan as an Expeditionary Engineer providing engineering
expertise, rapid design, and rapid prototyping to solve battlefield problems.
Projects included covert/overt surveillance systems, electrical power systems,
and vehicle systems that allowed soldiers to operate more safely and
effectively. I wrote extensively about my experiences, that blog is archived [here](/pages/afghanistan).

Examples of some of the other projects I supported can be found on the [REF
information page](http://www.ref.army.mil/exlab-solutions.html).

Our work was also featured in [several

Here are my coworkers standing in front of an Expeditionary Lab in Afghanistan.

This is what the inside of the Expeditionary Lab looks like.

I designed and built a bunch of these custom battery adapters that broke power out from a standard military battery into dual standard military plugs, a 12 V accessory plug, and dual USB charging ports.

I also designed and built this motion detecting remote camera kit.

This pelican case holds a control system to run a programmable, modular, interactive target practice system. The dials and switches control the motion and timing of moving target holders.

This is the box that held the target motion actuator.
