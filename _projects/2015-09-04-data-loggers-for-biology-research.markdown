summary: Data loggers and custom egg enclosures for biology research.
---

In collaboration with Dr. Geoff Bower and Professor Scott Shaffer (San Jose
State University, Department of Biological Sciences), I developed a data
logger for studying the nesting habits of birds.  I also designed and
fabricated 3D-printed artificial egg enclosures for the loggers.  This work
was published in [PLoS
ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0097898).

Here's what the data logger looks like. It's small and very low power.

The eggs are printed in Shapeways' strong and versatile plastic (nylon) and designed with tight fitting threads for assembly. If for some reason you want your own eggs, you can buy them from [my shop on Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/shops/engineerfs).

The data logger and its battery fit snugly in the compartment built into the egg.
