summary: Sense and avoid for autonomous eVTOL air taxis.
---

I joined Airbus in their new Silicon Valley office (A<sup>3</sup>) in late 2016 
to work on a sense and avoid system to enable the [Vahana](https://acubed.airbus.com/blog/vahana/) 
electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle to fly as a self-piloted, fully 
autonomous air taxi.

Vahana went from a literal napkin sketch in early 2016 to a 
[first flight](https://acubed.airbus.com/blog/vahana/vahanas-first-flight-a-success/) 
of the fully autonomous, full scale aircraft in January 2018. 
Experiencing the first flight of Vahana was an absolute highlight of my career 
to date.

My contribution to Vahana was leading the sense and avoid subsystem 
team. We designed and built solutions to two key problems for self-piloted 
vehicles: how to detect and avoid other aircraft, and how to make sure 
a landing site is safe to land on. We demonstrated the full capability 
of our systems in testing on small multi-rotor UAVs and in 
hardware-in-the-loop simulation of Vahana.

The success of our work on Vahana generated strong interest from other 
parts of Airbus, and in 2018 we [spun out](https://acubed.airbus.com/blog/wayfinder/wayfinders-origin-story/) 
of Vahana into our own A<sup>3</sup> project called [Wayfinder](https://acubed.airbus.com/projects/wayfinder/).
