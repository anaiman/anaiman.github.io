summary: Innovative flying things.

In 2016, I had the opportunity to work at [Otherlab](https://www.otherlab.com) 
in a small team building innovative flying vehicles.

Our team, known variously as "Flying Things" and "Sky Machines", worked on several 
government and commercially funded projects pushing the limits of possibility for 
autonomous aerial vehicles.

In one DARPA-funded project that we called [APSARA](https://www.otherlab.com/blog-posts/cardboard-drone), I led design, integration, and testing of a rapidly biodegradable, 
low-cost glider. Taking advantage of Otherlab's unique rapid prototyping capabilities 
in laser-cut corrugated cardboard, I revamped our vehicle design, improved its 
robustness and manufacturability, and enabled a 2-week-or-less design/build/test cycle.

I also supported work on [Tether-tenna](https://www.vox.com/2017/5/4/15364938/facebook-drone-startup-internet-beaming-helicopter-everfly), 
a tethered helicopter configuration aircraft built to carry an internet 
connectivity payload for [Facebook](https://engineering.fb.com/connectivity/connectivity-a-building-block-approach/).
