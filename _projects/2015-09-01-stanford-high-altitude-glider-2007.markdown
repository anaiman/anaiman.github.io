summary: Our group built a rocket-launchable glider for science! And for fun.
---

In this student initiated (extracurricular) project, we built an autonomous
airplane to be launched in the stratosphere via weather balloon or rocket.
The airplane was designed to carry a science payload, glide while collecting
data, then return to a predetermined landing point autonomously.

For this project, I designed and implemented the high level system control
state machine.Â  I also assisted with airframe fabrication and flight testing.

This is the glider that we designed and built with its wing stored in the launch configuration. The wing was designed to be deployable so that the glider could fit into a rocket payload envelope.

After launch, the wing was deployed with a servo-controlled mechanism.

We flew the glider as a weather balloon payload for testing. We added some foam to protect sharp edges for the balloon test.

Here we are preparing to launch the weather balloon with our payload train underneath it.

Our glider sucessfully deployed its wing and landed safely in a field after floating up over 60,000 feet under the balloon.
