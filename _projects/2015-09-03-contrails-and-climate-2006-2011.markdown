My doctoral research focused on the impacts of commercial aviation on climate.
I conducted large eddy simulations of the condensation trails (contrails) that
form behind cruising jets and investigated the sensitivity of contrail
properties to different initial and ambient conditions.  I also developed a
parameterized model of contrail dynamics that is currently used in a global
atmospheric model to assess the impacts of aviation on air quality and
climate.
