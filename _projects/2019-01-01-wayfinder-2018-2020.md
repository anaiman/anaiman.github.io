summary: Creating autonomous flight and machine learning solutions to enable self-piloted aircraft operations.

I currently lead the engineering team for [Wayfinder](https://acubed.airbus.com/projects/wayfinder/) 
at Airbus in their Silicon Valley office (A<sup>3</sup>).

I wrote about how Wayfinder started on our [project blog](https://acubed.airbus.com/blog/wayfinder/wayfinders-origin-story/).

In short, we are building machine learning based solutions to allow aircraft to operate safely with 
fewer or no pilots on board. You can read more about the details on our [project blog](https://acubed.airbus.com/blog/wayfinder/).
