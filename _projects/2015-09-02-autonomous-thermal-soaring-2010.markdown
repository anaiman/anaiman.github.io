As a follow-on to a [class final project](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2006
/BowerNaiman-JustKeepFlyingMachineLearningforUAVGustSoaring.pdf) for CS229 -
Machine Learning (Stanford University Computer Science Department, 2006), I
participated in a Phase I STTR from Office of Naval Research to develop
machine learning based enhancements for unmanned aircraft.

The goal of this project was to demonstrate increased endurance for persistent
surveillance missions by unmanned aircraft using naturally occurring thermal
updrafts.  I worked to design and implement the control algorithm, and model
the updraft physics for our flight simulations.  Our results showed that our
algorithm enabled a simulated aircraft to achieve 62% of possible improvement
in mission endurance and were presented at the [AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and
Control conference in 2010](http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2010-8031).
