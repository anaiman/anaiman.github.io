summary: Flying image collection systems for agricultural aerial imagery.
---

As Lead Hardware Engineer at [TerrAvion](http://www.terravion.com), I was
responsible for developing, designing, and integrating all aspects of our
flying image collection systems.

The collection systems consisted of a set of sensors (high resolution cameras
in several bands, position/orientation sensors, and a few others) connected to
a control and data collection server in the airplane.  I therefore was able to
get my hands dirty with just about every engineering discipline covered:

  * Embedded Linux software - I maintained and improved the code base that controlled the various sensors (C/C++, Bash, Python)
  * Mechanical design and fabrication - I designed and built a collection system based on alternative components in order to reduce our risk by providing a diversity of suppliers (SolidWorks, vendor sourcing, manual machining, and assembly)
  * Power and data delivery - I maintained and improved the cabling and circuits used to power, control, synchronize, and receive data from the collection system (soldering, cable harnesses, and strain relief)
  * User interface design and implementation - I developed and implemented a web server and front-end interface to allow operation of the collection system by contractors with minimal training (Python, HTML, CSS)
  * Data and database management - I managed the collection and storage of data (up to 1 TB per flight) from the cameras until it was uploaded to our corporate cloud for processing (SQLite, PostgreSQL)

In all these areas, I focused on improving the performance, modularity,
usability, and reliability of the hardware to increase uptime for operations.
TerrAvion's product requires consistent, high quality imagery and other sensor
data that must be collected in a difficult environment.  Balancing between
technical development, regulatory constraints, operational considerations, and
cost tradeoffs provided an exciting challenge every day.
