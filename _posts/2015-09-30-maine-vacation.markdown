Lena and I just returned from a week-ish in Maine, where one of my friends
from high school was getting married.  It was a nice getaway for us with
highlights including apple picking, water views, lobster, hiking, and a very
short visit with my parents.  I hadn’t been to Maine since I was about 8 years
old, but I wouldn’t mind going back soon!

Apples. They just don’t make ‘em like this in California.

Water view from the house we were staying at on Mount Desert Island.

Lobster dinner – some disassembly required, instructions included.

Hiking sometimes includes climbing ladders, I guess.
