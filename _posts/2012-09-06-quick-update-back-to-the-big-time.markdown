I’m back on KAF tonight after a quick and easy flight from Masum Ghar this
afternoon.  I got to fly back on a CH-47 Chinook, which was cooler than I
thought it would be.  A Chinook is a big, two rotor helicopter that holds 30+
people plus a bunch of cargo.  It doesn’t have great windows (they’re sort of
fish-eye shaped and small), but if you have the right seat, the view is still
good.  That’s because the tail gunner sits on the loading ramp at the rear of
the passenger area with his feet dangling off the end and they fly with the
ramp most of the way open.  I was about third from the end on the flight today
so I had a very good view.  I also made sure my seat belt was on tightly.  No
photos today, sorry . . . I’ll try harder next time.

One last note on Masum Ghar: one thing I won’t miss about the FOB where I
spent the last three weeks is this sign:

Not everyone followed this procedure exactly (me neither), but I definitely
didn’t want to “lose the right to shower in this facility”, since I’m not sure
where any other facilities were.  Not that anyone was actually enforcing this
rule, but still.  I’m sort of glad to be back at KAF, where I can take regular
showers.  Although after one night, I’m already missing the dinners at the
Masum Ghar DFAC.
