This is my first post, but I'm leaving explanations about this blog to the
[About](/pages/about/ "About") section.  Let's
jump right in to my first real week of predeployment preparations.

You should see the checklist of things I have to deal with before I leave.
It's a fun checklist.  If you want to know almost everything I know, you can
look at the [Camp Atterbury
website](http://www.campatterbury.in.ng.mil/CivilianContractorDeploymentRedeploymentInfo/tabid/1101/Default.aspx)
\- I'll be heading there for CRC/IRDO right before I deploy. I'm not sure if
it's still called CRC (CONUS Replacement Center), or if IRDO (Individual
Replacement Deployment Operations) is something different, so I'll just go
ahead and keep using those two terms interchangeably.  Did you like the nested
acronym in CRC?  I'm sure it won't be the last.  See below for my first AOTD
(acronym of the day).

Anyway, this week I'm dealing with immunizations.  Here are the required
vaccinations:

  * Hepatitis A
  * Hepatitis B
  * Influenza
  * Meningitis
  * Measles/Mumps/Rubella
  * Polio
  * Tetanus/Diphtheria/Pertussis
  * Typhoid
  * Yellow Fever (maybe?)
  * Varicella (aka, chicken pox)
  * Rabies (optional)
  * Anthrax
  * Smallpox

Yikes, that's a lot of needles.  Fortunately, I got all of the normal ones as
a kid, leaving only Hep A, Meningitis (I might have had these vaccinations
already, but I don't have records of it), TDaP (due for a booster), Typhoid
(pills, not a shot), and Yellow Fever (which I may or may not need).  I'm
going to skip Rabies (note to self: don't pick up any animals in Afghanistan),
but I'll be getting the Anthrax and Smallpox vaccines when I go through CRC.
Throw in my PPD (the Tuberculosis skin test) and a myriad of blood tests, and
that's like 10 needle sticks.  Awesome fun times.

AOTD: CONUS - CONtinental United States.  This is opposed to OCONUS, which is
Outside of CONUS.  Some sources say that it's actually CONtiguous (as in the
lower 48, whereas continental could include Alaska).  In my mind, OCONUS means
outside of the 50 states, really - but who ever said acronyms had to make
sense?  Anyway, since I don't have either Hawaii or Alaska on my itinerary,
OCONUS is functionally equivalent to "foreign countries".
