title: A much needed relaxing weekend
type: post

Lena and I went to [Half Moon Bay](http://goo.gl/maps/5LD0) (over the hills
from our place, on the coast) for a much needed relaxing weekend, our last
free weekend before I deploy to Afghanistan.  We stayed at a nice bed and
breakfast in the little downtown area.

Saturday was bright and sunny, so we drove over to Pescadero and rode a 20
mile loop over to the Pigeon Point lighthouse.

Yep, I’m going to miss this for the next few months . . .![DSCN0056]({{
