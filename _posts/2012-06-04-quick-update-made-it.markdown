I spent last night in Dubai and flew out early this morning on a commercial
flight to Kandahar.  I got in around noon with all of my luggage present and
intact and spent the afternoon starting to get a little oriented with my new
home.  First impression: it’s really dusty here.  Not that I’m surprised,
people told me it would be, and they were definitely right.

I’m wiped out, so I’m going to bed.  More updates will come soon.
