I finished up with IRDO this morning, and I'm currently waiting for my flight
out at the Indianapolis airport.  I'm heading from here to DC tonight, where
I'll catch a flight out to Dubai, arriving Saturday afternoon (their local
time).  I definitely feel more like I'm on my way, now.  More updates to come
when I get a chance!

Edit: Or not.  Thunderstorms in DC today, and you know how United works with
weather . . . not at all.  So I'm spending another night in Indiana and I'll
try again tomorrow.

thunderstorms around today.
