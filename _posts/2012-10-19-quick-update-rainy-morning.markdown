The weather took a turn for the rainy last night.  I thought I heard rain on
the roof while I was sleeping, but I thought I might just be dreaming.  Then I
woke up to find everything outside wet – looks like this was  good, soaking
rain.  The dust was kept down pretty nicely today and the temperature stayed
under 80.

Wet deck and driveway.

The rain is a nice change, but I hope it doesn’t happen too often before I
leave (in less than three weeks!!!).  Much more of this is going to lead to
mud everywhere, mosquitoes, and needing my raincoat.

In other news, I need to take more photos so I have stuff to write about.
Anything you want me to write about before I leave here (in less than three
weeks!!!)?  Leave a comment.
