title: 'Quick Update: The countdown is getting low'
type: post
---

Well, clearly I failed at posting more this week.  My countdown is now
officially under six days (until I leave KAF, about seven until I get home),
my replacement is coming in tomorrow, and I’m really starting to pack up and
check out.  I actually am packing up – I’m going to let Charlie move into the
main room so he can get settled and I’m going to move all my stuff over to an
empty room on the REF side of the building.

I have nothing interesting to show you photos of, so instead, here’s a list of
what I’ll be missing when I leave paired with all the things I won’t be
missing.


|**Things I’ll miss about KAF**|**Things I WON’T miss about KAF**              |

That’s all for now.  I promise at least one more post (about some project
work) before I leave KAF.  Out of here in less than six days!
