I made it home, safe, sound, and even on time yesterday around noon Pacific
time.Â  I'm still dealing with some serious jet lag (a 12.5 hour time change
plus a night spent jammed into economy seating during a 15 hour flight will do
that), so I'll post about my trip sometime later, but I'm very happy to be
home.
