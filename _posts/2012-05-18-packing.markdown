It’s hard to pack for five months in Afghanistan.  I mean, this going to a war
zone thing is fairly new to me.

Most of the stuff I’m bringing is clothing.  The trick there is figuring out
what to wear to a) look professional while b) working outside in 110 F heat.
I bought a lot of what one my bosses likes to call “tactical polos”, which are
otherwise known as golf shirts.  Except maybe less colorful.  I also bought
myself a ton of boot socks – half midweight wool hiking socks, half
lightweight synthetics.  We’ll see which ones keep my feet happy and hold up
to lots of abuse.![DSCN0071]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dscn0071.jpg)

It’s a good thing we have a guest bedroom.  And it’s a good thing we don’t
have too many guests using it.
