title: London Olympics, Cambridge style

As the rest of the world gears up for the Olympics, you might imagine that KAF
would not want to feel left behind.  Never fear, the British DFAC, which is
called Cambridge, has stepped up to the plate.

First, yes, it’s a “British cuisine” dining facility, which you might not
think would be that exciting.  I don’t believe that the British are generally
known for their cuisine.  Actually, though, the TCN interpretation is
surprisingly good, and really there isn’t that much British-y about the food.
The décor is another story, though.  The walls are covered in decorations to
make it look like someone’s idea of “British”.  There a bunch of Tube signs.
There’s wallpaper that looks like fancy wood paneling on some walls, ivy
growing up brick on others.  And then they have these all around the walls:

That looks way more realistic in the photo than it does in person.  So how do
you dress up such a high brow, classy establishment for the Olympics?  By
displaying exciting cardboard cutouts of the five greatest Olympic events that
everyone always watches, of course: discus throwing, wheelchair racing, golf,
judo . . .

(I think that last one is judo, but who really knows), and the greatest sport
of all (and quintessentially British, so it totally makes sense),

polo.  As usual, I really want to know who makes these decisions . . . I’m
also curious about what the block color shapes are on all the athlete cutouts.
I think they might say “2012” in a really weird font, but all of the ones I
took photos of came out backwards.  Even the ones hanging on the back wall so
you can’t see them from the side that would show it as “2012” (in the first
photo).  KAF weird strikes again, I guess.

AOTD: LNO – LiaisoN Officer.  As in, someone who serves as a liaison between
two different organizations in the military, which is probably one of the most
thankless jobs anyone could ever have around here.  And without LNOs, nothing
would ever get done around here.  I also like the acronym that takes the last
letter of a word . . . that’s always fun.  This one reminds me of my
internship at Boeing, where the word liaison was pronounced LYE-azon.
Speaking of weird.
