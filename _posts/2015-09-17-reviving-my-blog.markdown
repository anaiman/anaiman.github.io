title: Reviving my Blog
type: post
---

This blog has been completely neglected since I returned home from Afghanistan
in 2012, but I've recently found myself with more free time on my hands than
I've had in a while.  I've therefore decided to revive and update it.

For those of you paying attention, you may notice that I have already applied
a new theme and formatting, focusing less on the Afghanistan stuff and more on
what else I've been up to.  Since I'm not in Afghanistan anymore, and the once
potential minor sensitivity of some of my posts has diminished to zero with
the passing of time, I have also opened the site up for public view.  I'm
planning to post regularly, but we'll see how that goes.

Here we go!
